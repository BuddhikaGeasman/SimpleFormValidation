### Problems I have ran in to

- [x] onLoad the page should not display required error as this is the initial render.
- [x] needs to check whether the errors has generated, if not required should not be displayed.
- [ ] needs to update the helper functions appropriatley, overall isValid property, then build errors as a good UX

### todo

- [ ] work on mobile view
- [ ] Write tests
